# SSD300-Keras-Tensorflow
Implementation of SSD (Single Shot Detection) in python using the Tensorflow and Keras libraries. The architecture is described in the following paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.02325.pdf. I used the PriorBox class that can be found on this repositery: https://github.com/rykov8/ssd_keras/blob/master/ssd_layers. py. The code is not yet commented on.
